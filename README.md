# Phase Compatibility Model for NiTi Shape Memory Alloys

This repository is dedicated to NiTi Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) and offers comprehensive tools and models for researchers and engineers. Key features include:

- **Functionality for Parameter Calculation:** Enables the computation of $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, and $\lambda_3$ parameters in NiTi SMAs.
- **Compositional Feature Analysis:** Tools to calculate various compositional features (e.g., jarvis_avg_first_ion_en_divi_voro_coord, jarvis_dev_mol_vol, hea_Delta).
- **Transformation Prediction Model:** An innovative model to estimate $\lambda_2$ values and predict the type of phase transformation (B2 to B19 or B19') in NiTi SMAs, based exclusively on their composition.
- **Extensive Dataset:** Includes lattice parameter, thermodynamic response, and a range of other relevant features for NiTi SMAs, accessible in [data.csv](/Phase-Compatibility-Model-NiTi/blob/main/data.csv)
